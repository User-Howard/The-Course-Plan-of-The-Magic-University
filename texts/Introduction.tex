\hspace*{2cm} This poster is the opinions and answers put forward on the topic "The Course Plan of The Magic University" of the Mathematical Modeling Hackathon. The topic requires that daily courses be arranged in the nine-day curriculum of three semesters. Each course has a physical strength value and points, which represent the physical strength required to learn this class and the points that can eventually be obtained. And you are not allowed to spend more than 100 points of physical strength every day. Find the average value of this plan implemented many times and find the best course selection strategy. 

\hspace*{2cm} The following which is based on the points is our understanding of the topic and the proposed solutions .We utilize the program and compares ratios of points and physical strength values to find the average points obtained by multiple implementations of this plan.
